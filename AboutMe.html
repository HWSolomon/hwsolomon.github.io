									<span class="image right"><img src="images/home.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I am from a city near Amsterdam called Zaandam. I was born and raised there and have spent most of my life in this place.</p>
									<p>During my last year of high school I struggled with finding the next study I wanted to do. In the end I decided to go and do something I had never done before which was coding. I had looked up some online lessons and gotten interested through that and applied for Media College</p>
									<p>In the first 2 years I learned a lot. I started out as someone who had no real idea on how to plan, work in a team or code in general and now I know a lot about all of these things.</p>
									<p>Although I have learned a lot I still want to learn more.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Where am I now</h3>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/now.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Currently in my second year of Game Development at Media College.</p>
									<p>At Media College I have mostly worked with the unity engine for nearly all of my projects but I am planning on learning more about other engines in the near future.</p>
									<p>Working both in a team and alone are things I am comfortable with and have no issue with doing. I have had to do projects both alone and in a group which have all gone well.</p>
									<p>I am planning on learning far more and building up more experience so I can be good at whatever job I do.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Where am I going</h3>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/future.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I want to continue my study into becoming a software engineer. I know that even after I am done at Media College there is a lot more I could learn and I plan on learning as much as I can.</p>
									<p>For an internship I want a place where I can get a feel for what it is really like to be a programmer/developer. Not just to be studying at a place besides school but preferably do actual work even if its just meneal tasks so I can learn from it.</p>
									<p>I really want to learn more and possibly work with AI in the future. Whether it is the AI from a computer game or a robot AI I really think it is a very interesting subject and one I would be lucky to work with.</p>
